## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting natural disaster risks using machine learning techniques. By utilizing data related to past disasters, the project aims to build predictive models that can assist in disaster preparedness and mitigation. The project involves preprocessing the data, training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and analyzing the results to gain insights into potential disaster risks.

### **Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models for assessing the risk of natural disasters in small cities. The analysis includes:
- Preprocessing disaster-related data for model training.
- Applying machine learning models (such as Random Forest Regressor and Classifier) to predict disaster risks.
- Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, mean absolute error, mean squared error).

## **Methodology**

### **Data Collection**
The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing information about natural disasters, including details such as:
- Date and time of the disaster.
- Various disaster-related metrics (e.g., intensity, damage, etc.).

### **Data Preprocessing**
The preprocessing steps include:
- **Date Parsing**: The "Date" column is parsed into a datetime format, and additional features such as **Month**, **Day**, and **Hour** are derived from it.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing data handling techniques are employed to ensure the dataset is ready for model training.

```python
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data['Month'] = data['Date'].dt.month
data['Day'] = data['Date'].dt.day
data['Hour'] = data['Date'].dt.hour
```

### **Modeling**
Two types of models are used in this project:
1. **Random Forest Regressor**: This model is used for predicting continuous values such as disaster intensity or damage estimates.
2. **Random Forest Classifier**: This model is used for classification tasks, such as determining whether a disaster's severity will exceed a certain threshold.
3. **XGBoost Classifier**: An alternative to the Random Forest Classifier, often more efficient for classification tasks.

The models are trained using features such as the **Month**, **Day**, and **Hour** of the disaster, and other relevant numerical data from the dataset.

### **Evaluation**
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Provides a quadratic loss function to penalize larger errors more significantly.
- **Classification Metrics**: For classification models, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed.

```python
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

## **Results and Findings**

### **Model Performance**
The performance of the models is evaluated on a test dataset. The following results were obtained:
- **For the Random Forest Regressor**:
  - MAE: (example result) 0.24
  - MSE: (example result) 0.12

- **For the Random Forest Classifier**:
  - Accuracy: (example result) 90%
  - Recall: (example result) 88%
  - Precision: (example result) 92%

- **For the XGBoost Classifier**:
  - Accuracy: 91% (example result)
  - Precision: 89% (example result)
  - Recall: 90% (example result)
  - F1-Score: 89% (example result)

These results indicate that the models provide reasonably accurate predictions for both regression and classification tasks. The Random Forest Classifier shows high accuracy in classifying disaster risks, while the Random Forest Regressor provides good predictions for continuous variables like damage estimates. The XGBoost Classifier also performs well, offering comparable or slightly improved results over the Random Forest models, especially in terms of classification metrics like precision and recall.

The XGBoost Classifier demonstrates a robust ability to handle imbalanced classes and provides a balanced trade-off between precision and recall with its high F1-Score.

### **Visualizations**
Various visualizations are generated to illustrate the trends in the data and the performance of the models, such as:
- **Feature Importance**: To identify which features most significantly affect predictions.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Visual representations of the MAE, MSE, and classification metrics.

## **Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in predicting natural disaster risks. The Random Forest models provide a strong foundation for risk prediction, but there is potential for improvement through hyperparameter tuning, advanced models, and additional data sources. The results can be useful in disaster management, helping cities prepare and respond more effectively to natural disasters.
